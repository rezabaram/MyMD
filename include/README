The structure of the code

The main part of the MD is done in class CSys in mdsys.h. 
Different components are separated in different header files 
and are included (directly or indirectly) in mdsys.h:

- exception.h: A class for producing informative exceptions (errors)
- common.h: Some routines used in different places
- config.h baseconfig.h: Configuration classes an input parameters definitions
- vec.h: Vector template class with simple algebraic operatoins. 
	 vec2d and vec3d are shorthands for 2 and 3 dimensional vectors (Resp.)
- matrix.h: A borrowed simple matrix class used mainly for ellipsoid.h
-
