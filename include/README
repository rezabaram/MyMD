The structure of the code

The main part of the MD is done in class CSys in mdsys.h. 
Different components are separated in different header files 
and are included (directly or indirectly) in mdsys.h:

- exception.h: A class for producing informative exceptions (errors)
- common.h: Some routines used in different places
- config.h baseconfig.h: Configuration classes an input parameters definitions
- vec.h: Vector template class with simple algebraic operatoins. 
	 vec2d and vec3d are shorthands for 2 and 3 dimensional vectors (Resp.)
- matrix.h: A borrowed simple matrix class used mainly for ellipsoid.h
- quaternion.h: A class for quaternion
- geombase.h: Class CGeomBase is the class from which all shapes are derived.
- sphere.h: Class for sphere 
- ellipsoid.h: Class for ellipsoid
- cylinder.h: Class for cylinder (not complete)
- packing.h: A container for particles with more functionalities.
- composite.h: Class for a particle composed of several spheres (maybe not fully working)
- ray.h: Class for a line in 3D space which can intersect with other geometric shapes.
- box.h: The class for system boundaries which can be periodic or solid
